High Power Rocketry - Flight Simulation

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a extensbile flight simulation package for high power rocketry, using only open-source tools. Other projects with a similar scope & application are OpenRocket & RASAero II:

The intent is to use a python-C++ binding library to interface between python and C++ source. Simulation input & post-processing is to be handled by python, while the bulk of the numerical work done with C++.

Future work may include a user interface using PyQt5.

## Setup
