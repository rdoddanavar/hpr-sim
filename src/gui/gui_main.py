# Only needed for access to command line arguments

# You need one (and only one) QApplication instance per application.
# Pass in sys.argv to allow command line arguments for your app.
# If you know you won't use command line arguments QApplication([]) works too.

# Create a Qt widget, which will be our window.

window.show()  # IMPORTANT!!!!! Windows are hidden by default.

# Start the event loop.
gui.exec()

# Your application won't reach here until you exit and the event
# loop has stopped.
